2023-02-12: GBC PRO v2.3

It recently has been detected a strange malfunction
that can occur only in this specific situation and not always,
it happens occasionally:

    With the GBC turned off, you plug in the USB-C cable and then power on the GBC.
    Occasionally the red light will turn off just after the GBC is turned on,
    and then the charging circuit will get very hot until it is damaged.

    It works properly when the GBC is already on and then the USB-C cable is connected.
    Or when the GBC is charging but it remains off.

However, I highly recommend not charging and playing at the same time to avoid any problem
(like the previous version which didnâ€™t support it).
