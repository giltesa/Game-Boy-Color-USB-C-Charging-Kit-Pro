# Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit PRO

The **Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit PRO** is the new circuit for **Nintendo Game Boy Color**. This time is all in one circuit and includes not only the **charging controller** but also a **boost converter** and **audio amplifier**.

The modern **IPS displays** with background light require more energy than the stock display. Also, **the flash cards** to load tons of games consume the battery very fast. If you really want to enjoy the games, the best way to do it is using a rechargeable battery instead of AA batteries.

However, that is not enough because a higher consume is forcing the original electronic to strive more than it can. That may cause noise in the speaker or headphones.

Typical solution has been adding a charging circuit for the battery and a power converter to replace the old and not efficiently one which is included in the GBC. Some people also add an audio amplifier to hear better the speaker sound. All these things make the GBC perfect, however the installation require a lot of cables and can not be easy for some people without enough knowledge.

Typical installation of the 3 modules:

*(Thanks Sascha for the photo of his installation!)*

For resolving that, this new **Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit PRO** includes the three circuits in one, everything wired each other, and you will just need to solder a few points to the GBC board.
