The **Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit PRO** is the new circuit for **Nintendo Game Boy Color**. This time is all in one circuit and includes not only the **charging controller** but also a **boost converter** and **audio amplifier**.

The modern **IPS displays** with background light require more energy than the stock display. Also, **the flash cards** to load tons of games consume the battery very fast. If you really want to enjoy the games, the best way to do it is using a rechargeable battery instead of AA batteries.

However, that is not enough because a higher consume is forcing the original electronic to strive more than it can. That may cause noise in the speaker or headphones.

Typical solution has been adding a charging circuit for the battery and a power converter to replace the old and not efficiently one which is included in the GBC. Some people also add an audio amplifier to hear better the speaker sound. All these things make the GBC perfect, however the installation require a lot of cables and can not be easy for some people without enough knowledge.

Typical installation of the 3 modules:

*(Thanks Sascha for the photo of his installation!)*

For resolving that, this new **Game Boy Color USB-C Charging Kit PRO** includes the three circuits in one, everything wired each other, and you will just need to solder a few points to the GBC board.

## This board includes

### Li-ion battery charger chip TP5000:
TP5000 is a switching buck single lithium battery charge management chip. Its QFN16 ultra-compact package making the TP5000 is ideal for portable equipment large current charging management applications. Meanwhile, TP5000 built-in input overcurrent, undervoltage protection, over temperature protection, short circuit protection, battery temperature monitoring, reverse battery protection.


### Boost Converter chip MT3540:
The MT3540 is a constant frequency, 5-pin SOT23 current mode step-up converter intended for small, low power applications. The MT3540 switches at 1.2MHz and allows the use of tiny, low cost capacitors and inductors 2mm or less in height. Internal soft-start results in small inrush current and extends battery life.


### Audio Amplifier chip PAM8302A:
The PAM8302A is a 2.5W Class-D mono audio amplifier. Its low THD+N feature offers high quality sound reproduction. The new filterless architecture allows the device to drive speakers directly instead of using low-pass output filters, therefore saving system cost and PCB area.


## FEATURES

-   Exact shape for Game Boy Color.
-   Li-Ion battery charger by USB-C with protection for charging level and overdischarge.
-   DC to DC converter (only 5V output, not compatible with the original display).
-   Audio amplifier for the speaker with a potentiometer called VR1 to setup the maximum volume.
-   Integrated LED indicators on the main board, next to the USB for charging battery (red) and full battery (green). It can be disabled by the jumper SJ1.
-   External LED indicators board for playing (white), charging battery (red) and full battery (green). Optional installation.
